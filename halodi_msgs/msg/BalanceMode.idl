          * AUTOMATIC: The balance controller will try to stay stationary, but switch to driving if a driving command is received or the robot is pushed.
          * DRIVING: The balance controller is in driving mode. This allows faster reaction than AUTOMATIC, at the cost of less strict postion keeping
          * FOLLOW_ME: The balance controller heavily favours moving the base to balance, allowing easy pushing of the robot.
          * DISABLED: The balance controller will be disabled (CAUTION, NOT IMPLEMENTED)
